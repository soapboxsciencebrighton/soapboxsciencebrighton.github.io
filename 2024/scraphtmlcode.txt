<div class="speaker_txt">
Iris Asllani graduated from University of Tirana with a degree in Theoretical Nuclear Physics.  A two-time Fulbright Scholar, she obtained her Master's and PhD from the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Washington.  She spent the following decade at Columbia University where she spearheaded the Arterial Spin Labeling program in the then newly established MRI Center.  She currently holds a dual faculty appointment in Clinical Imaging Sciences Centre (CISC) at the University of Sussex, UK, and in Biomedical Engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), USA. Her main research area is metabolic imaging using MRI.  More recently, her research has expanded to developing and implementing multi-modal neuroimaging methods for a comprehensive assessment of the brain's metabolism.  In addition to research and teaching, Dr. Asllani serves as the Vice President of the Consortium for Advancement of MRI Education and Research in Africa (CAMERA) and is a faculty advisor for Engineering World Health (EWH).
