<div class="speaker_txt">
Cristina is a highly accomplished postdoctoral research fellow with a PhD in neurosciences from the world-renowned University of Oxford. Throughout her academic career, Dr Martinez-Gonzalez has established herself as a leader in neuroscience.
Dr Martinez-Gonzalezâ's work investigates rodent models of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) by making the brain transparent (optical tissue-clearing and light-sheet microscopy). Her expertise in this area is unparalleled, having developed new tissue clearing, immunohistochemical protocols and viral manipulation strategies in rodents. In addition to these innovative techniques, her diverse skill set includes confocal microscopy, anatomy, stereotaxic surgery, and molecular biology. 
Throughout her career, Dr Martinez-Gonzalez has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to advancing our understanding of ASD and other neurological disorders. Her contributions to the field are not only significant but have the potential to be truly transformative. Dr Martinez Gonzalez's selected publications include research articles in Nature Neurosciences, Brain, and Neuron. Dr Martinez Gonzalez is an exceptional researcher who will continue to be influential in the scientific community for years to come.

<b>Danielle Lauren Kurtin</b><br><br>
<i>Orchestrating how we think: an exploration of communication between brain regions</i>
  <br><br>
  Presentation slot: <b>2pm-3pm</b>
  </div>
<div class="speaker_txt">
Originally from a small fishing town in Florida, Danielle first began researching the brain as an intern at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, where she investigated how Deep Brain Stimulation attenuated symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Fascinated with the clinical potential of brain stimulation, she then completed her MSc in Translational Neuroscience at Imperial College London. There she investigated how the effects of noninvasive brain stimulation on brain function change depending on when stimulation was delivered. The realisation that stimulating the same brain region had opposing effects depending on whether a participant played a task or sat quietly inspired further investigation. She then spent her PhD at the University of Surrey evaluating methods that characterised brain connectivity reconfigurations and how they subserve behaviour and cognition. Danielle recently submitted her thesis and is continuing her research as a member of the Interventional Systems Neuroscience group at Imperial College London.

She then moved to the Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, where she obtained a series of prestigious fellowships (EMBO, JRF-Henslow Fellowship, Wellcome Trust Strategic grant) to conduct her researcher studying the development of the motor system. In 2015, funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society, she started her laboratory studying the role of Hox genes for the diversification of neural circuits, in the Department of Zoology, at the University of Cambridge. She joined the University of Sussex in 2019.

<i>Why does brain injury increase the risk of dementia?</i>
  <br><br>
  Presentation slot: <b>11am-12noon</b>
  </div>
<div class="speaker_txt">
Kamar is a lecturer in biomedical science at Teesside University where her research uses human post-mortem brain tissue to understand how neuroinflammation drives the progression of neurodegenerative diseases which lead to dementia, and how traumatic brain injury is a risk factor for dementia. Kamar obtained her PhD in behavioural neuroscience and neurobiology from Durham University which involved refining rodent recognition memory tasks to understand the processes of memory function. Following her PhD, Kamar worked at the University of Sheffield using a mouse model of Alzheimerâ€™s disease to assess the relationship between cognitive impairment and progression of disease pathology, with a specific focus on immune cells in the brain called microglia, and how their function is altered in Alzheimerâ€™ disease. In her next research positions at Newcastle University and then University of Glasgow, Kamar used human post-mortem brain tissue to investigate altered microglial function following stroke and traumatic brain injury, respectively.

Miren developed a passion for the brain when she volunteered with a group of individuals with brain palsy at the end of high school. She then went on to study a BSc. in Physics at the University of Zaragoza, where she very much enjoyed learning about the biophysics of neurons. She then did an MSc. in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology at the University of Barcelona with the idea of designing biocompatible structures to interact with the brain. She was then awarded a fully-funded Ph.D. scholarship at the University of Oxford, where she studied the multiphysics of the neuronal signal with the aim of using non-invasive mechanical waves to restore neurological pathologies. She is now a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Kingâ€™s College London, where she studies Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and other comorbidities in individuals with Down syndrome.
